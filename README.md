## About the project

Welcome to my Infinite Scroll project! ðŸš€

A simple React Web App with infinite scrolling, favourites, Flickr API integration and cool visual indicators and done as a part for Vinted Academy program.

**Tech Stack**:

In this project I've used:

- **Vite+React+TypeScript**: For fast development with modern build tooling, Reactâ€™s component model, and TypeScriptâ€™s type safety.
- **Module CSS**: For styling the project.
- **Vitest**: For running tests.
- **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.

**Objective**:

The primary goal of this assignment is to showcase proficiency in modern web development practices, including:

- **API Integration**: Fetching paginated data from the Flickr API (or a similar API) and displaying unique images with relevant metadata.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Loading additional data as the user scrolls down the page, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.
- **Favouriting Items**: Users can mark items as favorites, with the favorite state persisting even after a page reload.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application is fully responsive across multiple devices (Desktop, Tablet, Phone) with at least three breakpoints.
- **Responsive Images**: Loading higher-quality images only when necessary to reduce data usage and improve loading times.
- **Lazy-Loading Images**: Implementing lazy loading to optimize performance by loading images only when they are about to enter the viewport.
- **Testing**: Writing tests to ensure code reliability and demonstrate testing practices.

Additional functionality:

- **Remove Favorite Functionality**: Added a feature that allows users to remove favorited items from their favorites list.
- **Scroll to Top Button**: A button that appears when the user scrolls down, allowing them to smoothly scroll back to the top of the page.
- **Loading Spinner**: Displays a spinning icon while images are being fetched, enhancing the user experience by indicating that content is loading.
